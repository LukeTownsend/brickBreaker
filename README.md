# brickBreaker
This is a webpage for a brick breaker game.

You must bounce the ball of the platform at the bottom of the screen to break the bricks at the top. Letting the ball hit the bottom of the screen will destroy a life. If all 3 lives are depleted then an alert will let you know you lost. If you destroy all the bricks an alert will show you've won.

You can move the platform with the arrow keys or your mouse cursor.
